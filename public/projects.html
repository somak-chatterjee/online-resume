    <li><h2>Energy Consumption Behavior in Workflow Applications</h2></li>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Master Thesis</h3></li>
        <li>Research project wherein I had attempted to find the trend of energy and power consumption across multiple
            releases of large scale workflow management systems. For my thesis, I had selected Apache Airflow as my
            case-study.</li>
        <li>The idea was to compare the energy consumption between patch and major releases. For this, I ran multiple
            releases of Airflow and stress-tested them by running multiple workloads. I then measured the power and
            energy usage of the CPU on the host system.</li>
        <li>I had also attempted to understand the impact of code refactoring on energy use. To do this, I used an opensource
            refactoring detection tool (PyRef) to extract the refactorings to Airflowâ€™s codebase, built two versions of
            the same (one with the refactoring and one without) and repeated the process of stress-testing the two
            versions and measuring the power and energy use.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Project for Machine Learning Course for the University of Groningen</h3></li>
        <li>This project was created to implement a simple Convoluted Neural Network and train it for classification of
            breast cancer cells as malignant or benign.</li>
        <li>The CNN model was created and designed using the PyTorch library and x-ray mammogram images from the
            CBIS-DDSM: Breast Cancer Image Dataset was used as the dataset on which the model was trained and tested.</li>
        <li>The performance of the CNN was then compared with previous models that were used for classification on the
            same dataset.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Project for Scalable Computing Course for the University of Groningen</h3></li>
        <li>A simple web-application for carrying out predictive maintenance application which would monitor the status
            of different components of machinery and inform the user which parts needed maintenance and/or replacing.</li>
        <li>TThe application uses a csv file containing data about different parts. This is then converted to a json file and
            stored in a MongoDB database</li>
        <li>The application then splits the data set for training and testing the predicitive model. The training data is split
            into batches and each batch is divided into n subsets by the machine ID. Each batch is assigned to a worker on
            Apache Spark. The subsets are processed using Map/Reduce and the metrics for each subset is mapped to the
            corresponding machine ID and reduced. After this, the subsets are joined together.</li>
        <li>A simple logistic regression is used for the predictive model and tested on the dataframe created in the
            previous step. The test data is then streamed to Spark as an input and the predictions are hosted on a Flaskbased
            web application.</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/rug-wacc/2022_group_4_s5351251_s5381541_s3167895"><h2>Interior Design Application (CID)</h2></a></li>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Project for Web and Cloud Computing Course for the University of Groningen</h3></li>
        <li>Project which created CID, a web application to connect clients and designers and allow them to work on
            projects in a real-time collaborative 3D editor. Clients and designers can create profiles through the web
            application. Then, the client can create a project and propose it to a designer.</li>
        <li>The front-end of the application was created using SvelteJS as the framework for building the single-page
            application. Along with using Tailwind CSS for creating class-based CSS components, Axios HTTP client was also
            used for accessing the backend API asynchronously as well as well as using Three.js, a Javascript Library for 3Drendering.</li>
        <li>The backend makes use of the following tools and frameworks: Nodejs for backend API implementation,
            MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching live editing session data , RabbitMQ for queuing the same and
            Nginx for serving the front-end and load balancing the front-end and APIs</li>
